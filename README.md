# Converting-Data-into-Numbers-
An Ml Model which converts data into numbers which an Ml model understands.

Steps-
1. Get the data ready for ml model
2. Differentiate x and y i.e. x = data except traget variable(feature variables) y=target / label variable
Here we are checking someone has heart disase or not using RandomForeset Classifier
3. Split data into training and test data
4. Fit the data
5. Check how well the our model has learned.

1. Checking whether someone has heart disease or not 
Using RandomForestClassifier
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Predicting Car Price for which we Will be converting data into numbers
Using RandomForestRegressor

We will use OneHotEncoder and columnTransformer for converting categories into numbers.
